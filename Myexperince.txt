At the beignning I started with Frontend and create responsive pages.
After,I went through backend which is little bit time consuming for me.Even though I knew the flow and process,
I don't know how to implement it.So, I started reffring from web and learned new things like hashing on
secret key , flash module and sessions.
Additionally like all project I faced some error while debbuging .But fixing the errors is like 
different kind of happiness for me.
